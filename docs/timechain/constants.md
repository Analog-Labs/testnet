___


## babe
 
### epochDuration: `u64`
- **interface**: `api.consts.babe.epochDuration`
- **summary**:    The amount of time, in slots, that each epoch should last.  NOTE: Currently it is not possible to change the epoch duration after  the chain has started. Attempting to do so will brick block production. 
 
### expectedBlockTime: `u64`
- **interface**: `api.consts.babe.expectedBlockTime`
- **summary**:    The expected average block time at which BABE should be creating  blocks. Since BABE is probabilistic it is not trivial to figure out  what the expected average block time should be based on the slot  duration and the security parameter `c` (where `1 - c` represents  the probability of a slot being empty). 
 
### maxAuthorities: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.babe.maxAuthorities`
- **summary**:    Max number of authorities allowed 

___


## balances
 
### existentialDeposit: `u128`
- **interface**: `api.consts.balances.existentialDeposit`
- **summary**:    The minimum amount required to keep an account open. MUST BE GREATER THAN ZERO! 

   If you *really* need it to be zero, you can enable the feature `insecure_zero_ed` for  this pallet. However, you do so at your own risk: this will open up a major DoS vector.  In case you have multiple sources of provider references, you may also get unexpected  behaviour if you set this to zero. 

   Bottom line: Do yourself a favour and make it at least one! 
 
### maxFreezes: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.balances.maxFreezes`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of individual freeze locks that can exist on an account at any time. 
 
### maxHolds: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.balances.maxHolds`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of holds that can exist on an account at any time. 
 
### maxLocks: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.balances.maxLocks`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of locks that should exist on an account.  Not strictly enforced, but used for weight estimation. 
 
### maxReserves: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.balances.maxReserves`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of named reserves that can exist on an account. 

___


## council
 
### maxProposalWeight: `SpWeightsWeightV2Weight`
- **interface**: `api.consts.council.maxProposalWeight`
- **summary**:    The maximum weight of a dispatch call that can be proposed and executed. 

___


## electionProviderMultiPhase
 
### betterSignedThreshold: `Perbill`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.betterSignedThreshold`
- **summary**:    The minimum amount of improvement to the solution score that defines a solution as  "better" in the Signed phase. 
 
### betterUnsignedThreshold: `Perbill`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.betterUnsignedThreshold`
- **summary**:    The minimum amount of improvement to the solution score that defines a solution as  "better" in the Unsigned phase. 
 
### maxElectableTargets: `u16`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.maxElectableTargets`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of electable targets to put in the snapshot. 
 
### maxElectingVoters: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.maxElectingVoters`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of electing voters to put in the snapshot. At the moment, snapshots  are only over a single block, but once multi-block elections are introduced they will  take place over multiple blocks. 
 
### maxWinners: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.maxWinners`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of winners that can be elected by this `ElectionProvider`  implementation. 

   Note: This must always be greater or equal to `T::DataProvider::desired_targets()`. 
 
### minerMaxLength: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.minerMaxLength`
 
### minerMaxVotesPerVoter: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.minerMaxVotesPerVoter`
 
### minerMaxWeight: `SpWeightsWeightV2Weight`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.minerMaxWeight`
 
### minerMaxWinners: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.minerMaxWinners`
 
### minerTxPriority: `u64`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.minerTxPriority`
- **summary**:    The priority of the unsigned transaction submitted in the unsigned-phase 
 
### offchainRepeat: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.offchainRepeat`
- **summary**:    The repeat threshold of the offchain worker. 

   For example, if it is 5, that means that at least 5 blocks will elapse between attempts  to submit the worker's solution. 
 
### signedDepositBase: `u128`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.signedDepositBase`
- **summary**:    Base deposit for a signed solution. 
 
### signedDepositByte: `u128`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.signedDepositByte`
- **summary**:    Per-byte deposit for a signed solution. 
 
### signedDepositWeight: `u128`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.signedDepositWeight`
- **summary**:    Per-weight deposit for a signed solution. 
 
### signedMaxRefunds: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.signedMaxRefunds`
- **summary**:    The maximum amount of unchecked solutions to refund the call fee for. 
 
### signedMaxSubmissions: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.signedMaxSubmissions`
- **summary**:    Maximum number of signed submissions that can be queued. 

   It is best to avoid adjusting this during an election, as it impacts downstream data  structures. In particular, `SignedSubmissionIndices<T>` is bounded on this value. If you  update this value during an election, you _must_ ensure that  `SignedSubmissionIndices.len()` is less than or equal to the new value. Otherwise,  attempts to submit new solutions may cause a runtime panic. 
 
### signedMaxWeight: `SpWeightsWeightV2Weight`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.signedMaxWeight`
- **summary**:    Maximum weight of a signed solution. 

   If [`Config::MinerConfig`] is being implemented to submit signed solutions (outside of  this pallet), then [`MinerConfig::solution_weight`] is used to compare against  this value. 
 
### signedPhase: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.signedPhase`
- **summary**:    Duration of the signed phase. 
 
### signedRewardBase: `u128`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.signedRewardBase`
- **summary**:    Base reward for a signed solution 
 
### unsignedPhase: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.electionProviderMultiPhase.unsignedPhase`
- **summary**:    Duration of the unsigned phase. 

___


## grandpa
 
### maxAuthorities: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.grandpa.maxAuthorities`
- **summary**:    Max Authorities in use 
 
### maxSetIdSessionEntries: `u64`
- **interface**: `api.consts.grandpa.maxSetIdSessionEntries`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of entries to keep in the set id to session index mapping. 

   Since the `SetIdSession` map is only used for validating equivocations this  value should relate to the bonding duration of whatever staking system is  being used (if any). If equivocation handling is not enabled then this value  can be zero. 

___


## imOnline
 
### unsignedPriority: `u64`
- **interface**: `api.consts.imOnline.unsignedPriority`
- **summary**:    A configuration for base priority of unsigned transactions. 

   This is exposed so that it can be tuned for particular runtime, when  multiple pallets send unsigned transactions. 

___


## staking
 
### bondingDuration: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.bondingDuration`
- **summary**:    Number of eras that staked funds must remain bonded for. 
 
### historyDepth: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.historyDepth`
- **summary**:    Number of eras to keep in history. 

   Following information is kept for eras in `[current_era -  HistoryDepth, current_era]`: `ErasStakers`, `ErasStakersClipped`,  `ErasValidatorPrefs`, `ErasValidatorReward`, `ErasRewardPoints`,  `ErasTotalStake`, `ErasStartSessionIndex`,  `StakingLedger.claimed_rewards`. 

   Must be more than the number of eras delayed by session.  I.e. active era must always be in history. I.e. `active_era >  current_era - history_depth` must be guaranteed. 

   If migrating an existing pallet from storage value to config value,  this should be set to same value or greater as in storage. 

   Note: `HistoryDepth` is used as the upper bound for the `BoundedVec`  item `StakingLedger.claimed_rewards`. Setting this value lower than  the existing value can lead to inconsistencies in the  `StakingLedger` and will need to be handled properly in a migration.  The test `reducing_history_depth_abrupt` shows this effect. 
 
### maxNominations: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.maxNominations`
- **summary**:    Maximum number of nominations per nominator. 
 
### maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.maxNominatorRewardedPerValidator`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of nominators rewarded for each validator. 

   For each validator only the `$MaxNominatorRewardedPerValidator` biggest stakers can  claim their reward. This used to limit the i/o cost for the nominator payout. 
 
### maxUnlockingChunks: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.maxUnlockingChunks`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of `unlocking` chunks a [`StakingLedger`] can  have. Effectively determines how many unique eras a staker may be  unbonding in. 

   Note: `MaxUnlockingChunks` is used as the upper bound for the  `BoundedVec` item `StakingLedger.unlocking`. Setting this value  lower than the existing value can lead to inconsistencies in the  `StakingLedger` and will need to be handled properly in a runtime  migration. The test `reducing_max_unlocking_chunks_abrupt` shows  this effect. 
 
### sessionsPerEra: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.sessionsPerEra`
- **summary**:    Number of sessions per era. 
 
### slashDeferDuration: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.staking.slashDeferDuration`
- **summary**:    Number of eras that slashes are deferred by, after computation. 

   This should be less than the bonding duration. Set to 0 if slashes  should be applied immediately, without opportunity for intervention. 

___


## system
 
### blockHashCount: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.blockHashCount`
- **summary**:    Maximum number of block number to block hash mappings to keep (oldest pruned first). 
 
### blockLength: `FrameSystemLimitsBlockLength`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.blockLength`
- **summary**:    The maximum length of a block (in bytes). 
 
### blockWeights: `FrameSystemLimitsBlockWeights`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.blockWeights`
- **summary**:    Block & extrinsics weights: base values and limits. 
 
### dbWeight: `SpWeightsRuntimeDbWeight`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.dbWeight`
- **summary**:    The weight of runtime database operations the runtime can invoke. 
 
### ss58Prefix: `u16`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.ss58Prefix`
- **summary**:    The designated SS58 prefix of this chain. 

   This replaces the "ss58Format" property declared in the chain spec. Reason is  that the runtime should know about the prefix in order to make use of it as  an identifier of the chain. 
 
### version: `SpVersionRuntimeVersion`
- **interface**: `api.consts.system.version`
- **summary**:    Get the chain's current version. 

___


## taskSchedule
 
### payableTimeoutLength: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.taskSchedule.payableTimeoutLength`
- **summary**:    Minimum length in blocks before payable task is determined to be timed out 
 
### recurringTimeoutLength: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.taskSchedule.recurringTimeoutLength`
- **summary**:    Minimum length in blocks before recurring task is determined to be timed out 

___


## tesseractSigStorage
 
### maxChronicleWorkers: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.tesseractSigStorage.maxChronicleWorkers`
 
### maxTimeouts: `u8`
- **interface**: `api.consts.tesseractSigStorage.maxTimeouts`
- **summary**:    Maximum number of task execution timeouts before shard is put offline 
 
### slashingPercentage: `u8`
- **interface**: `api.consts.tesseractSigStorage.slashingPercentage`
- **summary**:    Slashing percentage for commiting misbehavior 
 
### slashingPercentageThreshold: `u8`
- **interface**: `api.consts.tesseractSigStorage.slashingPercentageThreshold`
- **summary**:    Slashing threshold percentage for commiting misbehavior consensus 

___


## timestamp
 
### minimumPeriod: `u64`
- **interface**: `api.consts.timestamp.minimumPeriod`
- **summary**:    The minimum period between blocks. Beware that this is different to the *expected*  period that the block production apparatus provides. Your chosen consensus system will  generally work with this to determine a sensible block time. e.g. For Aura, it will be  double this period on default settings. 

___


## transactionPayment
 
### operationalFeeMultiplier: `u8`
- **interface**: `api.consts.transactionPayment.operationalFeeMultiplier`
- **summary**:    A fee mulitplier for `Operational` extrinsics to compute "virtual tip" to boost their  `priority` 

   This value is multipled by the `final_fee` to obtain a "virtual tip" that is later  added to a tip component in regular `priority` calculations.  It means that a `Normal` transaction can front-run a similarly-sized `Operational`  extrinsic (with no tip), by including a tip value greater than the virtual tip. 

   ```rust,ignore  // For `Normal`  let priority = priority_calc(tip); 

   // For `Operational`  let virtual_tip = (inclusion_fee + tip) * OperationalFeeMultiplier;  let priority = priority_calc(tip + virtual_tip);  ``` 

   Note that since we use `final_fee` the multiplier applies also to the regular `tip`  sent with the transaction. So, not only does the transaction get a priority bump based  on the `inclusion_fee`, but we also amplify the impact of tips applied to `Operational`  transactions. 

___


## treasury
 
### burn: `Permill`
- **interface**: `api.consts.treasury.burn`
- **summary**:    Percentage of spare funds (if any) that are burnt per spend period. 
 
### maxApprovals: `u32`
- **interface**: `api.consts.treasury.maxApprovals`
- **summary**:    The maximum number of approvals that can wait in the spending queue. 

   NOTE: This parameter is also used within the Bounties Pallet extension if enabled. 
 
### palletId: `FrameSupportPalletId`
- **interface**: `api.consts.treasury.palletId`
- **summary**:    The treasury's pallet id, used for deriving its sovereign account ID. 
 
### proposalBond: `Permill`
- **interface**: `api.consts.treasury.proposalBond`
- **summary**:    Fraction of a proposal's value that should be bonded in order to place the proposal.  An accepted proposal gets these back. A rejected proposal does not. 
 
### proposalBondMaximum: `Option<u128>`

- **summary**:    Maximum amount of funds that should be placed in a deposit for making a proposal. 
 
### proposalBondMinimum: `u128`

- **summary**:    The limit on the number of batched calls. 

___


## vesting
 
### minVestedTransfer: `u128`
- **interface**: `api.consts.vesting.minVestedTransfer`
- **summary**:    The minimum amount transferred to call `vested_transfer`. 

___


## voterList
 
### bagThresholds: `Vec<u64>`
- **interface**: `api.consts.voterList.bagThresholds`
- **summary**:    The list of thresholds separating the various bags. 

   Ids are separated into unsorted bags according to their score. This specifies the  thresholds separating the bags. An id's bag is the largest bag for which the id's score  is less than or equal to its upper threshold. 

   When ids are iterated, higher bags are iterated completely before lower bags. This means  that iteration is _semi-sorted_: ids of higher score tend to come before ids of lower  score, but peer ids within a particular bag are sorted in insertion order. 

   #### Expressing the constant 

   This constant must be sorted in strictly increasing order. Duplicate items are not  permitted. 

   There is an implied upper limit of `Score::MAX`; that value does not need to be  specified within the bag. For any two threshold lists, if one ends with  `Score::MAX`, the other one does not, and they are otherwise equal, the two  lists will behave identically. 

   #### Calculation 

   It is recommended to generate the set of thresholds in a geometric series, such that  there exists some constant ratio such that `threshold[k + 1] == (threshold[k] *  constant_ratio).max(threshold[k] + 1)` for all `k`. 

   The helpers in the `/utils/frame/generate-bags` module can simplify this calculation. 

   #### Examples 

   - If `BagThresholds::get().is_empty()`, then all ids are put into the same bag, and  iteration is strictly in insertion order. 

  - If `BagThresholds::get().len() == 64`, and the thresholds are determined according to the procedure given above, then the constant ratio is equal to 2. 

  - If `BagThresholds::get().len() == 200`, and the thresholds are determined according to the procedure given above, then the constant ratio is approximately equal to 1.248. 

  - If the threshold list begins `[1, 2, 3, ...]`, then an id with score 0 or 1 will fall into bag 0, an id with score 2 will fall into bag 1, etc. 

   #### Migration 

   In the event that this list ever changes, a copy of the old bags list must be retained.  With that `List::migrate` can be called, which will perform the appropriate migration.
