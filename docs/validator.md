# Validator setup
## overview
Timechain blockchain is a permissionless network, anyone can join and help to verify the blocks. Timechain is based on substrate framework, current consensus is NPoS. So validator can get the reward according to the staking and block production. 

Timechain extends the client functionality like data fetch from external blockchain, send transaction to external blockchain and using TSS to verify any event or state, TSS signatures storage submission and storage in Timechain. All these extended and off-chain functionalities is implemented by chronicle worker, which share the same binary with Timechain node. It is mandatory for Timechain validator to run chronicle worker to involve in off-chain function execution. Chronicle worker also is rewarded according to its contribution.


## hardware
For hardware requirement, reference to the [Polkadot validator hardware](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#initial-set-up)

As mentioned overview, Timechain validator also needs to run chronicle node. The requirement for hardware is higher than running a polkadot validator. Other factor is the block slot is 3.6 seconds for Timechain, higher throughput is expected.

### CPUs

Recommended:  

- Storage-optimized solutions such as ***non-volatile memory express (NVMe)***
 and ***solid-state disks (SSDs)***
- x86_64 (Intel, AMD) processor with at least 32 physical cores

### RAM

- Recommended: 32 GB

### Disk

- Recommended: 2 TB SSD

## OS
The latest Ubuntu is recommended to run validator.

## Software

### deploy binary
You can build binary from scratch or download the image with right version from analog docker hub.

#### build binary
- install tools according to substrate env setup [build env](https://docs.substrate.io/install/) or follow the doc [rust-setup](./rust-setup.md) in the same folder
- run 
```sh
cargo +nightly build --release
```

#### download the docker image
get from analog docker hub with right version.
```sh
docker image pull analog/timechain-node:latest
```

### SDK installation
TODO
if any SDK is needed in validator node.

## account
### account for validator 
For validator, you need a [session key](https://docs.substrate.io/deploy/keys-and-network-operations/).

### account for TSS
chronicle worker need to run the TSS service, to sign event data and verify fetched data. 
TODO how to generate TSS account

## staking 
To become a validator node, you need stake Analog token. The [official instruction](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#bond-dot).

TODO
we may have the different frontend for Analog validator to stake.

## Connector service
Connector is a Rust-based package that implements Coinbaseâ€™s Rosetta API. The chronicle worker uses it to interact with external chain. You can run your own Connector or service provided by Analog.
For validator, you need three arguments to start the node.
- connector-url
- connector-blockchain
- connector-network

### Run your own Connector
You can follow the [Connector instruction](https://github.com/Analog-Labs/chain-connectors#readme).


## start the validator
the command line is like
```
  ./target/debug/timechain-node --validator --port 30335 --base-path /var/validator \
    --ws-port=9947 --rpc-port=9948 --chain mainnet --charlie \
    --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/12D3KooWEyoppNCUx8Yx66oV9fJnriXwCcXwDDUA2kj6vnc6iDEp \
    --connector-url http://rosetta.analog.one:8081 --connector-blockchain ethereum --connector-network dev \
    >./ind_validators/validator3/out_validator3 2>&1 &
```
To guarantee the node could be automatically started after unexpected exit, you can use daemon tool to start the node.

## TSS shard
Each TSS shard is a group, they work together to sign data and finalized the TSS process. According to TSS algorithm, you can create the TSS group with different number of TSS node.In Timechain network, we create the TSS shard via extrinsic. Every task just be executed by single TSS shard. User can specify the TSS shard type according to node number.

In the future, the shard will be created automatically after the node become validator and validator can set the shard type. With efficient computing resource, validator can join multiple TSS shard.

## network
The Timechain node need several different ports for all services.
- p2p interface with other Timechain node, default port is 30333.
- RPC service, port number is 9943
- WS service, port number is 9944

To use the rosetta service, we need to know its IP and port.
The default one provided by Analog is http://rosetta.analog.one:8081

## monitor 
You need to install monitor system to know the status of validator node. You can check [polkadot node monitor](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-monitor-your-node)

Analog will extend the service to monitor the chronicle worker.
